To build the code in this library, "cd build" and then type "cmake ..". Then 
type "make" in the build directory and the shared library liberpiLibrary.so 
should be built. To deploy the library to your Raspberry Pi type "sudo make 
install" in the same directory. You should also place the library in the 
/exploringrpi/library directory if you are building the various examples in 
the chapters.

The parent directory /exploringrpi/library currently contains a shared (.so) 
and statically linked version (.a) of the library. See the examples on how 
to use this library. For example see exploringrpi/chp09/LCDcharacter/build, 
which contains:

g++ LCDApp.cpp ../../library/liberpiLibrary.so -o LCDApp -I "../../library"

You can also use the static library by typing:

g++ LCDApp.cpp ../../library/liberpiLibrary.a -o LCDApp -I "../../library"

The steps involved are explained in detail at www.exploringrpi.com/chapter9/

BUILDING DOCUMENTATION (perform this step on a desktop computer - not the RPi)

To build the documentation for this library, enter the docs directory and type:
  exploringrpi/library/docs$ sudo apt-get install doxygen
  exploringrpi/library/docs$ doxygen ExploringRPi.Doxyfile 
The html documentation is built in the html directory and the LaTeX 
documentation can be built latex directory if you have LaTeX installed (not 
recommended on the RPi itself).
